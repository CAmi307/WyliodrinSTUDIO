Deploy Application
======================

Having in mind the diversity of languages, frameworks, architectures, and interfaces, **deploying an application** allows users to easily
develop and run their programs and projects. **Deploying** basically means to put an application into production, after its prototype is finished and tested.
The application then will be able to start automatically and run in the background.

For the moment Wyliodrin Studio provides support just for **Docker**.
 

Steps to use Docker in Wyliodrin Studio
***************************************
This feature contains two main parts. Firstly, you can deploy projects using the **Deploy** button.

After pressing it, the **Dockerfile** pop-up will appear.

.. image:: images/dockerfilePopup.png
	:align: center

This means that you do not have any dockerfile in the folder of your project. You now have the posibility to create a dockerfile through **Wyliodrin Studio**,
or to make one of your own. If you choose the first path, you will be able to customize your dockerfile in the **Deployment Settings** pop-up.

	:align: center

In this dialog, you have multiple options to customize you dockerfile.
The process options are: 

.. list-table::

	* - Interactive
	  - the container is running in the foreground and has the console attached
	* - Service
	  - the container is running in detached mode


The restart options are:

.. list-table::

	* - Do not restart
	  - do not automatically restart the container when it exits
	* - Always
	  - restart the container always, regardless of the exit status
	* - On failure
	  - restart the container only when it exits with a non-zero status
	* - Unless stopped
	  - always restart the container, except if it was put into stopped state before the Docker daemon was stopped.


The network options are:

.. list-table::

	* - Private
	  - use dockerâ€™s default networking setup
	* - Same as device
	  - use the host's network stack inside the container


Other options are:

.. list-table::

	* - Remove container at exit
	  - automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits
	* - Priviledged container
	  - give extended privileges and acces to all devices to the container


As you can see, there are already some default options set. However, you can always change them or add other options that you need in the **Additional Options** field.


By doing these actions, you succesfully deployed your project in a container. This container has the same name as your project and can be found in the **Deployments**
pop-up. This represents the second part of the **Docker** feature. By pressing the **Deployments** button you can manage both your containers created
in **Wyliodrin Studio**, and the ones created locally on your machine. 

.. image:: images/deploymentsButton.png
	:align: center

After pressing this button you will be shown a list of all the containers.

.. image:: images/deploymentsPopup.png
	:align: center

In the list you will find two types of containers. The ones with the **Wyliodrin Studio** logo are the one created inside the application, whilst
the ones with the docker icon are created locally. You may also see in which state the container can be found in that particular moment, as well as delete or 
stop the containers.
